"""fleet_stigmergy.py -- virtual stigmergy + emergent task specialization.

Paper #8: De Nicola et al. 2019, "Multi-agent systems with virtual
stigmergy". The channel folder IS the stigmergic medium: agents deposit
pheromone traces (signals, task claims, help-wanted cries) into
<channel>/.traces/ and coordinate by *reading the field*, not by
messaging each other. Each trace carries a TTL; its influence decays
linearly to zero, so stale information evaporates on its own and the
medium never needs a leader to clean it up.

Paper #9: Ferrante et al. 2015, "Evolution of Self-Organized Task
Specialization in Robot Swarms". Agents watch the claim traces, estimate
which task-types are under-served, and specialize into the thinnest roles
via local response thresholds. suggest_role() is the response-
threshold readout: it tells an agent which role the field *currently
needs*, and the fleet self-balances because agents follow the suggestion --
never because anyone assigns it. That is the whole point of the paper:
specialization must EMERGE from local readings, not be enforced top-down.

EMERGENCE vs ENFORCEMENT (design contract):
  * suggest_role() is ADVISORY ONLY. It reads state, returns a suggestion,
    writes nothing, runs nothing, orders nothing.
  * No function in this module ever assigns a task, changes an agent's
    behavior, or writes an "order" trace. If you want enforcement, build a
    different module -- enforcement in this one would be a lie about the
    papers it cites.
  * Task-type taxonomy is EMERGENT, not an enum (paper #7's warning against
    over-specified schemas): types are free-form strings agents choose
    when they call record_claim(). Convergent vocabularies arise because
    agents read each other's traces, the same way they arise in the
    papers' swarms.

Trace file layout (one JSON file per trace):
    <channel>/.traces/<kind>-<ts>-<agent-slug>-<rand4>.json
    {"kind": ..., "agent": ..., "strength": ..., "ttl_s": ...,
     "ts": <epoch float>, "note": ...,
     "task_type": ... (task-claim/help-wanted only),
     "task_id": ...   (task-claim only),
     "target_seq": ... (react only)}

The .traces dir starts with a dot, like .cursors/: the fork's cmd_channels
scandir filter (chat.py:453) and fleet_ephemeral's gc() both skip dot
entries, so traces never show up as channels and channel reaping never
touches them separately (the whole channel dir, traces included, is
archived and deleted as one unit).

Composition points (for the merge coordinator -- this module changes
nothing else):
  * fleet_tasks.py exists and has NO stigmergy hook: it logs claims to
    <channel>/tasks/_events.jsonl. Wire it by calling
    fleet_stigmergy.record_claim(root, channel, agent=owner,
    task_type=<free-form>, task_id=task_id) right after claim_task()
    returns True. The task_type string is up to the caller (agent's own
    vocabulary, or derived from the task title) -- do NOT close it into
    an enum.
  * fleet_ephemeral.py exists and reaps whole channels, not traces.
    reapable() lists past-TTL traces and sweep() deletes them; wire sweep
    into a periodic per-channel gc pass or a chat gc-traces command.

Stdlib only.

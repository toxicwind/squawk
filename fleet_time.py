"""fleet_time.py — Lamport logical clocks for fleet message ordering.

Paper steal #3: Leslie Lamport (1978), "Time, clocks, and the ordering of
events in a distributed system".

Why
---
Wall-clock `ts:` frontmatter cannot order fleet messages: agents run on
different machines, clocks skew, and `cmd_wait` polls on mtime. A Lamport
clock gives a causal order: every message carries a monotonically
increasing counter, and readers fold remote counters into their own clock.
Sorting by `(lamport, seq, agent_id)` yields a total order that is
*causally* consistent instead of wall-clock consistent.

Lamport rules (as implemented here)
-----------------------------------
- **Send event** (posting a message): ``tick(agent)`` — clock := clock + 1.
- **Receive event** (reading a message): ``observe(agent, remote_ts)`` —
  clock := max(clock, remote_ts). The +1 that classic Lamport does at
  receive time is intentionally deferred: it happens on the agent's *next*
  ``tick()`` (its next send). This keeps ``tick()`` the single place where
  the clock grows and keeps the receive path idempotent — re-reading the
  same message never advances the clock.

Frontmatter contract
--------------------
Field name: ``lamport:`` — a plain integer, e.g. ``lamport: 42``.
Messages written before this field existed are treated as ``lamport: 0``,
so causal sort degrades to the old seq order for legacy traffic.

Clock storage
-------------
Per-agent clock file: ``<root>/.clocks/<slugified-agent>`` holding a plain
integer (ASCII). Missing file == clock 0. Writes are atomic
(tmp file + ``os.replace``). Locks follow the base's ``_acquire_lock``
pattern (atomic ``mkdir``, stale-steal, timeout) implemented locally in
this module so it stays self-contained.

SINGLE-WRITER ASSUMPTION
------------------------
Each agent id is ticked/observed by **at most one process at a time**
(the agent's own process). The clock is *not* a shared counter across
agents — every agent owns its own file and only its own file.
Two processes of the SAME agent ticking concurrently are **unsupported**:
the per-clock lock makes the loser fail LOUD with ``ClockLockError``
instead of silently corrupting the counter. (Two *different* agents never
touch each other's files, so no cross-agent contention exists.)

Stdlib only. Add-only module: the merge coordinator wires hooks into
chat.py (see /tmp/extract-time/INTEGRATION.md).

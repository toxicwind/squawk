"""fleet_watch.py -- channel-discovery index for the file-only WhatsApp side.

Problem: the WhatsApp-side agent has no cheap way to discover NEW channels;
polling the chat root means a full directory scan per check.

Fix: whenever a channel is created, cmd_init appends exactly one line to
CHAT_ROOT/.channels-index (append-only, O_APPEND -- concurrent appends of
short lines are atomic on POSIX). The WhatsApp agent tails this single file
instead of scanning the root.

Line format (UTF-8):
    <iso-8601 ts>\\t<channel-name>\\n

API
    note_channel(root, name) -> Path
        Append one line for a newly created channel. Validates the name with
        the same traversal guards as base _check_safe_name (plus a ban on
        tab/CR/LF, which would corrupt the line format). Call AFTER _meta.json
        is written so a crashed init never indexes a half-made channel.
        Idempotent-ish: does NOT dedupe -- init already refuses duplicates,
        and readers dedupe by name (see below).

    watch_channels(root, since_offset=0) -> generator of (offset, name)
        Yield (byte_offset_after_this_line, channel_name) for every well-formed
        line after since_offset. The caller persists the last yielded offset
        and passes it back next time; malformed lines are skipped but their
        bytes are still jumped over by the next well-formed line's offset.
        Yields nothing when the index file does not exist yet (fresh root).

Reader contract (WhatsApp side):
    off = <stored offset, 0 on first run>
    for off, name in watch_channels(root, off):
        seen.add(name); off = off      # dedupe by name; keep newest offset
    store off; sleep/poll the single index file (or inotify-watch it).

Both functions are stdlib-only and never raise on I/O races (missing dir,
etc.) -- note_channel raises only on invalid names (programmer error).
